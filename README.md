# Social Media App

The purpose of this mobile application is to gain further understanding and experience in implementing popular social media application features such as newsfeeds, friends and friend requests, chatting and explore pages.

This project is being built to further understanding and experience in the following technical areas:

- database design and implementation
- react-native development
- user interface development
- async querying and handling promises

The initial idea is to re-create a mobile application resembling Instagram and then add / remove features as the project progresses.
